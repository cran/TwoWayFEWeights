\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data matrix.}

\item{Y}{Character string. The dependent variable in the regression. Y is the
level of the outcome if one wants to estimate the weights attached to the
fixed-effects regression, and Y is the first difference of the outcome if
one wants to estimate the weights attached to the first-difference
regression. Required.}

\item{G}{Character string. The variable identifying each group. Required.}

\item{T}{Character string. The variable identifying each period. Required.}

\item{D}{Character string. The treatment variable in the regression. D is the
level of the treatment if one wants to estimate the weights attached to the
fixed-effects regression, and D is the first difference of the treatment if
one wants to estimate the weights attached to the first-difference
regression. Required.}

\item{type}{Character string. The type of estimation strategy. Can take one
of four different values, each defining a unique combination of regression
strategy (either fixed-effects or first-difference) and inference
assumption (either common trends on its own or common trends plus an
additional assumption about treatment stability over time).
\itemize{
\item "feTR" (the default). Fixed-effects regression under the common trends assumption.
\item "feS". Fixed-effects regression under common trends and the assumption that groups' treatment effect does not change over time.
\item "fdTR". first-difference regression under the common trends assumption.
\item "fdS": first-difference regression under common trends and the assumption that groups' treatment effect does not change over time.
}}

\item{D0}{Character string. If \code{type = "fdTR"} is specified above, then the
function requires a fifth argument, \code{D0}. \code{D0} is the mean of the treatment
in group g and at period t. It should be non-missing at the first period
when a group appears in the data (e.g. at t=1 for the groups that are in
the data from the beginning), and for all observations for which the
first-difference of the group-level mean outcome and treatment are non
missing.}

\item{summary_measures}{Logical. Should the complementary results from the
computation of the weights be displayed? Specifically, the option outputs:
(i) the point estimate of the coefficient on the D variable from a TWFE
regression, (ii) the minimum value of the standard deviation of the ATEs
compatible with the coefficient from the TWFE regression and ATE across all
treated (g,t) cells being equal to zero, (iii) the minimum value of the
standard deviation of the ATEs compatible with the coefficient from the
TWFE regression and ATE across all treated (g,t) cells having different
signs (this is computed only if the sum of negative weights is different
from 0). See the FAQ section for other details.}

\item{controls}{Character string(s). An optional vector of control variables
that are included in the regression. Controls should not vary within each
group\emph{period cell, because the results in in de Chaisemartin &
D'Haultfoeuille (2020a) apply to two-way fixed effects regressions with
group×period level controls. If a control does vary within a group×period
cell, the command will replace it by its average value within each
group}period cell.}

\item{weights}{Character string. Specifies a column name in the input data
that replaces the default weighting scheme. If the regression is weighted,
the weight variable can be specified in weight. If \code{type="fdTR"} is
specified, then the weight variable should be non-missing at the first
period when a group appears in the data (e.g. at t=1 for the groups that
are in the data from the beginning), and for all observations for which the
first-difference of the group-level mean outcome and treatment are non
missing.}

\item{other_treatments}{Character string(s). An optional vector of other
treatment variables that are included in the regression. Note that this
option can only be used when \code{type = "feTR"} is specified above. While the
results in de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020a) do not cover two-way
fixed effects regressions with several treatments, those in de Chaisemartin
& D'Haultfoeuille(2020b) do, so the command follows results from that
second paper when other_treatments is specified. When it is specified, the
command reports the number and sum of positive and negative weights
attached to the treatment, but it does not report the summary measures of
the regression's robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects, as these
summary measures are no longer applicable when the regression has several
treatment variables. The command also reports the weights attached to the
other treatments. The weights reported by the command are those in
Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020b). See de
Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020b) for further details.}

\item{test_random_weights}{Character string(s). An optional vector that, when
specified, will cause the function to estimate the correlation between each
variable in the vector and the weights. Testing if those correlations
significantly differ from zero is a way to assess whether the weights are
as good as randomly assigned to groups and time periods.}

\item{path}{File path for saving the results in a valid csv file that
containing 3 variables (Group, Time, Weight). This option allows the user
to see the weight attached to each group*time cell. If the other_treatments
option is specified, the weights attached to the other treatments are also
saved.}

\section{FAQ}{


\emph{Q. How can one interpret the summary measures of the regression's robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects?}

When the two-way fixed effects regression has only one treatment variable, the command reports two summary measures of the robustness of the treatment coefficient beta to treatment heterogeneity across groups and over time.  The first one is defined in point (i) of Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020a). It corresponds to the minimal value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the treated groups and time periods under which beta and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) could be of opposite signs. When that number is large, this means that beta and the ATT can only be of opposite signs if there is a lot of treatment effect heterogeneity across groups and time periods. When that number is low, this means that beta and the ATT can be of opposite signs even if there is not a lot of treatment effect heterogeneity across groups and time periods. The second summary measure is defined in point (ii) of Corollary 1 in de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfoeuille (2020a).  It corresponds to the minimal value of the standard deviation of the treatment effect across the treated groups and time periods under which beta could be of a different sign than the treatment effect in all the treated group and time periods.

\emph{Q. How can I tell if the first summary measure is high or low?}

Assume that the first summary measure is equal to x. How can you tell if x is a low or a high amount of treatment effect heterogeneity? This is not an easy question to answer, but here is one possibility.  Let us assume that the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, to have that the mean of that distribution is 0 while its standard deviation is x, the treatment effects should be uniformly distributed on the \verb{[-sqrt(3)x,sqrt(3)x]} interval. Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect as large as \verb{sqrt(3)x}, while other cells have a treatment effect as low as \verb{-sqrt(3)x}? If the answer is negative (you think that it is not reasonable to assume that the treatment effect will exceed the \verb{+/-sqrt(3)x} bounds for some (g,t) cells), this means that the uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with an ATT of 0 and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider that the command's first summary measure is high, and that it is unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign. Conversely, if the answer is positive (you believe that the treatment effect might exceed the bounds for some (g,t) cells), it may not be unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.

The previous sensitivity exercise assumes that treatment effects follow a uniform distribution. You may find it more reasonable to assume that they are, say, normally distributed. Then you can conduct the following, similar exercise. If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation x normal distribution, 95\\% of them will fall within the \verb{[-1.96x,1.96x]} interval, and 5\\% will fall outside of that interval. Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that 2.5\\% of (g,t) cells have a treatment effect larger than 1.96x, while 2.5\\% have a treatment effect lower than -1.96?  If the answer is negative (you are willing to assume that at most 2.5\\% of the treatment effects fall out of the \verb{[-1.96x,1.96x]} interval at each side), this means that the normal distribution of treatment effects compatible with an ATT of 0 and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider that the command's first summary measure is high, and that it is unlikely that beta and the ATT are of a different sign.

\emph{Q. How can I tell if the second summary measure is high or low?}

Assume that the second summary measure is equal to x. To fix ideas, let us assume that beta>0. Let us assume that the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, one could have that those effects are all negative, with a standard deviation equal to x, for instance if they are uniformly drawn from the \verb{[-2sqrt(3)x,0]}. Then, you can ask yourself: is it reasonable to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect as low as \verb{-2sqrt(3)x}? If the answer is negative (you are not willing to assume that some (g,t) cells have a treatment effect lower than \verb{-2sqrt(3)x)}, this means that the uniform distribution of treatment effects compatible with sign reversal and a standard deviation of x seems implausible to you. Then, you can consider that the command's second summary measure is high, and that sign reversal is unlikely.  If the treatment effects of (g,t) cells are all negative, they cannot follow a normal distribution, so we do not discuss that possibility here.
